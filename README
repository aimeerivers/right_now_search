Right Now Search

I wanted something where you can search across multiple sites (Twitter, Google Blogs, Technorati, etc) from one search page, to get a real feel for the current 'buzz'.

Other people have done greasemonkey scripts, but i wanted something a little different. So i decided to make my own.

Try it out for yourself here: http://tinyurl.com/rightnowsearch

Or download the source code and use it locally yourself.

I need to style it nicely and put in Ajax auto updaters. Any help would be massively appreciated!
